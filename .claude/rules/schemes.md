Named, swappable, independently tested numerics: face interpolation, gradient
reconstruction, non-orthogonal correction, (eventually) Rhie–Chow. Governed by the
root `CLAUDE.md` Engineering Principles.

## Responsibility
- Reconstruction/interpolation/gradient/**limiting** **strategy classes** (each an `equinox.Module`
  implementing a scheme `Protocol`), each a **small single-responsibility class with a
  known order of accuracy**, unit-tested in isolation (reconstruct a known analytic
  field, check the convergence rate). All physics-free numerics live here — including the slope
  limiter — so the dependency stays one-way `discretization → schemes` (an operator/scheme injects
  a limiter; nothing in `schemes/` imports up into `discretization`).
- **`limiter.py` — BUILT.** `Limiter` (interface) → `VenkatakrishnanLimiter(k)`: a per-cell slope
  limiter `psi ∈ [0,1]` (smooth Venkatakrishnan 1993, `eps² = vol K³`), `limit(field, gradient,
  face_cells, geometry)`. Physics-free (verified in `tests/unit/test_limiter.py`), injected into
  `LimitedUpwind(limiter=…)` in `discretization/advection.py`, and evaluated only when that scheme
  runs (a diffusion-only or first-order solve never forms `psi`). See `.claude/rules/discretization.md`.
- **`gradient.py` — BUILT so far:** `GradientScheme` (interface) → `CompactGreenGauss`
  (one-shot `∇φ_P = (1/V_P) Σ φ_ip S_f`, linear-interpolated interior faces). Verified in
  `tests/unit/test_gradient.py`: linear-exact + 2nd-order on orthogonal grids;
  **inconsistent (order ~0) on irregular grids** — the deliberately-demonstrated
  Green–Gauss deficiency. Differentiable (`jax.grad` flows).
- **`CorrectedGreenGauss` — BUILT.** The non-orthogonal correction makes the gradient a
  *sparse coupled system* `A_g·G = B·φ` (`A_g` geometry-only, well-conditioned). **How `A_g⁻¹` is
  applied is an injected `GradientSolve` strategy** — `SweptGradientSolve` (**default**; fixed
  matrix-free Richardson sweeps) or `GmresGradientSolve` (matrix-free `lineax` GMRES, differentiable
  by implicit diff, for a mesh skewed enough that the swept sweep count would grow impractically); the
  discretization (`terms`/`operator`/`rhs`) is identical either way, so the swept path is **not** a
  separate scheme (it was `SweptCorrectedGradient`; retired). **Default is swept, not GMRES (binding,
  changed after the pitzDaily study).** GMRES is a *nested Krylov solve carrying its own implicit-diff
  tangent*, re-entered on every reconstruction; inside a nonlinear (coupled RANS) Newton it is
  re-differentiated by every Jacobian–vector product, which measured **2.16 s vs 0.014 s per
  coupled-residual eval** on the ~12k-cell pitzDaily backward-facing step (≈180×) — impractical for a
  real solve. The swept apply carries no nested solve, so it stays cheap under AD. The discretization-
  *exactness* unit tests (linear-exact, Gate-C one-step, the swept-vs-exact reference) pin
  `GmresGradientSolve()` explicitly, because they assert machine-precision properties the fixed
  `sweeps=4` default does not reach on a skewed mesh (it is exact only to within discretization error
  there — the swept solver's own accuracy is a separate, dedicated test). Verified:
  **linear-exact on irregular grids** (fixes compact GG's inconsistency), reduces to compact
  on orthogonal, but **measured to cap near 1st order** on irregular grids (the DeGroot-2019
  wall). **Now consumed by the diffusion residual** (`discretization/residual.py`) as the
  injected default for the non-orthogonal correction: folding it into `R` and letting AD form
  the Jacobian gives Gate C's one-Newton-step, linear-exact solve on a skewed mesh
  (`tests/integration/test_skewed_diffusion.py`).
- **`HessianCorrectedGradient` — BUILT (2D + 3D). The 2nd-order scheme, and the AD+Schur showcase.**
  Betchen's coupled gradient+Hessian reconstruction, with the **Hessian Schur-eliminated**
  (`schur=True` default) so only the gradient is the primary unknown: `S·g = b_g`,
  `S = A_gg − A_gH·A_HH⁻¹·A_Hg`, `A_HH` geometry-only, applied via an inner `lineax` solve.
  **All blocks come from AD** — the residual is the *forward* reconstruction (interpolations +
  Green–Gauss sums), never the paper's hand-derived coefficient matrices (Eq. 23–25). Verified:
  **exact for linear AND quadratic** on irregular grids (removes the cap), 2nd-order for smooth
  fields, **Schur result == full coupled solve to machine precision** (the elimination is
  exact), well-conditioned (~4 GMRES steps), differentiable through the nested solve. This is
  the drop-in `A_g`/`B` that later Schur-couples into the flow Newton (Hessian pre-eliminated,
  so the flow's inner block is gradient-sized). **Dimension-general (2D + 3D)**: the gradient's
  Hessian term uses Betchen & Straatman's Eq. (7) form — `−½ H:(x_ip−x_P)⊗(x_ip−x_P)` per face, from
  each cell's centroid-to-face vector (`_hessian_moment`) — so **no explicit face second-moment
  tensor** is needed; exact for quadratics on any **planar-faced** mesh. (An earlier 2D-only build
  evaluated it with an explicit edge second moment `(L³/12)(I−n̂n̂)` — the home-grown detour that
  caused the 2D limit; retired after checking the paper.) A warped-face grid (e.g. a fully-perturbed
  hex, whose quad faces bend) breaks Green–Gauss exactness for *every* scheme, so the 3D skew test
  skews a hex grid **in-plane** (`tests/support/meshes.py::columnwise_perturbed_grid_3d`, planar
  faces): exact-for-quadratic vs `CorrectedGreenGauss`'s ~0.08 error.
  **Validated inside the solve** (`tests/integration/test_betchen_solve.py`): injected as the
  residual's gradient scheme it nests correctly (the outer Newton `jvp` differentiates through
  Betchen's Schur solve *and* its inner `A_HH` solve — triply-nested), converges in one Newton
  step, and is differentiable on a skewed mesh. **Finding:** in *pure diffusion* the gradient
  enters only as a small non-orthogonal correction, so the solved **field** order is set by the
  operator floor (~2nd) and matches `CorrectedGreenGauss`; Betchen's win shows in the
  **reconstructed gradient / flux** of the solved field (~4× smaller error, higher order on
  skewed, where corrected Gauss caps near 1st — the `ResidualAssembler.gradient(phi)` accessor).
  The scheme matters most where the gradient enters a face value at leading order — advection /
  Rhie–Chow.
- **`SweptGradientSolve(sweeps)` — BUILT. The scalable `GradientSolve` strategy**, injected via
  `CorrectedGreenGauss(solver=SweptGradientSolve(n))` — **not a separate scheme** (same
  discretization as the GMRES path; only the `A_g⁻¹` apply differs). This is the efficient realization
  of absorbing the gradient into the flow system: `A_g` is geometry-only and constant, so its inverse
  can be applied far more cheaply than a fresh implicit-diff GMRES each call. Both solve strategies
  consume `CorrectedGreenGauss`'s reusable pieces — `terms(mesh,geom)` (geometry intermediates),
  `operator(terms)` (the constant matvec `A_g`), `rhs(terms,field,bvals)` (`B·φ`). It applies `A_g⁻¹`
  by a **fixed number of matrix-free inverse-volume-preconditioned Richardson sweeps**
  `g ← g + V⁻¹(B·φ − A_g·g)` (converges because `V` dominates `A_g`), differentiated by unrolling the
  short static loop — **no dense matrix, no nested Krylov, no implicit-diff tangent solve**. Sweep
  count to machine precision is **mesh-independent** (⇒ genuinely `O(n)`): 12 sweeps at 0.1 skew, 16 at
  0.2, 24 at 0.3 (grows with skewness, not mesh size). Exact drop-in (3.8e-10 vs GMRES). **~5× faster
  than `GmresGradientSolve` at N=32** (per coupled Newton step 112 s → 23 s run, 96 s → 23 s compile —
  the compile collapse shows the nested Krylov + implicit-diff control flow *was* the blow-up).
  Validated in the coupled skewed cavity (`tests/integration/test_swept_gradient_flow.py`): converges,
  matches the GMRES solution, differentiable through the nonlinear solve. The Schur complement
  `∂R/∂x + (∂R/∂g)A_g⁻¹B` is still formed by AD; only `A_g⁻¹` changes from a nested solve to a cheap
  unrolled sparse apply. **The default `GradientSolve` for `CorrectedGreenGauss`** (every flow mesh,
  not only skewed ones) — cheap to differentiate inside a nonlinear Newton, where the `GmresGradientSolve`
  nested Krylov+implicit-diff alternative is impractical (see the `CorrectedGreenGauss` note above).
  - **⚠️ EACH SWEEP COUPLES ONE FURTHER RING, so the sweep count sets the RESIDUAL's stencil reach —
    and the shipped `sweeps=4` is inconsistent with the shipped `stencil_reach=3` on a skewed mesh
    (measured 2026-08-16, harness `validation/gradient_stencil_reach.py`).** `A_g` couples a cell to its
    face neighbours, so `k` sweeps make the reconstruction read `k` cells out; a residual built on it
    reads `k + 1` (a face flux gathers the gradient of the cells on both sides). Measured exactly, at
    every skewness, on scalar Laplace on a 12×12 randomly perturbed grid, all-Dirichlet:

    | sweeps | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 8 | exact (GMRES) |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | reconstruction reach | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 8 | to round-off |
    | scalar residual reach | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 9 | 9–11 |

    **`sweeps=1` IS compact Green–Gauss** (`x₁ = V⁻¹Bφ`), correction and all reach included, so the
    useful range starts at 2. On the coupled RANS residual the base terms carry rings of their own —
    measured on a 6×6 skewed lid-driven cavity (first-order upwind, `DirectScalars`): reach **6** at
    `sweeps=4`, **4** at 2, i.e. `sweeps + 2` there. **So a reach is a property of the assembled case
    and must be measured, never derived from the sweep count.**
  - **⚠️ TRUNCATING THE SWEEPS DOES NOT REMOVE FAR COUPLING — it FOLDS it onto the last retained shell,
    and this is the finding that decides the design.** The mass beyond a given distance is set by the
    **mesh skewness**, not by the sweep count. At 25 % perturbation, `|dR/dφ|` beyond distance 2 is
    9.80e-4 at 2 sweeps, 1.004e-3 at 4, and 1.004e-3 at the exact solve — flat. Per-ring decay is
    ~1/37 at 25 % skew, ~1/6.6 at 40 %, ~1/240 at 5 %. Accuracy of the reconstruction against the exact
    solve, same runs: 3.6e-3 (2 sweeps) / 3.1e-5 (4) / 1.7e-8 (8) at 25 % skew; 1.1e-2 / 9.9e-4 / 2.5e-5
    at 40 %.
    **Consequence, and the reason "solve it exactly with GMRES instead" is the WRONG lever:** the exact
    solve is the sweep series run to round-off, so it has *strictly more* mass past any distance, not
    less — measured reach 9 at 25 % skew and 11 at 40 %, against 5 for `sweeps=4`. It also does not
    address why GMRES was rejected as the default (the nested implicit-diff tangent re-entered per jvp,
    ≈180× on pitzDaily), which a preconditioner inside that solve does not remove.
  - **`narrow_gradient_sweeps(tree, sweeps)` — BUILT (2026-08-16), the cap, for the PRECONDITIONER only.**
    Returns a copy of any tree (an assembled case, an assembler, a scheme) with every `SweptGradientSolve`
    in it capped; it only ever narrows (a solve already at or below the cap is returned by identity), and
    a `GmresGradientSolve` or `CompactGreenGauss` is untouched. It rebuilds each `equinox.Module` along
    the path with `dataclasses.replace` rather than `eqx.tree_at`, because `sweeps` is a **static** field
    and so lives in the treedef, not among the leaves — `tree_at` raises on it (`SweptGradientSolve` is an
    all-static Module, i.e. an *empty* pytree node, which `where` cannot locate). Every Module in
    `aquaflux` takes its fields as constructor arguments and none defines `__post_init__` / `__check_init__`,
    which is what makes `replace` faithful.
    **Why a cap rather than an exact solve:** a coloured probe recovers the Jacobian to a fixed distance
    and *folds* whatever lies beyond onto near entries, so probing a narrowed residual gives a matrix that
    is **exact for the residual it was taken from** — a stated approximation of the operator instead of a
    corrupted one. Consumed through `CoupledJacobianProbe(gradient_sweeps=…)` / the coupled builders'
    `probe_gradient_sweeps=`; see `.claude/rules/turbulence.md` and `.claude/rules/solve.md`. **Default
    `None` everywhere is byte-identical.**
    ⚠️ **This is LATENT on every case shipped today.** `bfs3d` and pitzDaily are orthogonal-enough that the
    skewness offset is ~0, the correction vanishes, and the sweep count changes neither reach nor value
    (measured: every shell beyond distance 1 at 1e-16 on an unperturbed grid, matching the recorded
    "swapping Corrected→Compact Green-Gauss leaves the reach bit-identical"). It bites on the first
    genuinely skewed case, which is why it was built before one exists rather than after.
  - **The `GradientSolve.solve(..., operator_hook=None)` distributed seam.** `operator_hook` is an
    optional transform applied to the unknown before **every operator apply**. `SweptGradientSolve`
    honours it — the Richardson sweeps form no global inner product, so a domain-decomposed residual
    can pass its ghost-cell exchange here to refresh the iterate's ghost rows each sweep, making the
    owned gradients serial-exact. `GmresGradientSolve` **raises** on a non-`None` `operator_hook` (its
    inner products span the whole local vector, double-counting ghost rows and unreduced across
    partitions), as does `HessianCorrectedGradient` (its nested Schur/`A_HH` solves read ghost
    gradients *and* Hessians the outer exchange does not refresh). This makes `SweptGradientSolve` the
    one gradient solve that runs under domain decomposition (the distributed non-orthogonal path; see
    `.claude/rules/parallel.md`).
- **Rejected alternative — dense LU of `A_g` (built, measured, removed; do not rebuild).** Factorizing
  the constant `A_g` once (dense, via `jit`-ed `jacfwd` + `lu_factor`) and applying `A_g⁻¹` by
  back-substitution is also exact, but dense ⇒ `O((n·dim)²)` per apply, so it is **strictly dominated by
  the swept solve at every mesh size** (measured run/step: N=12 0.27 vs 0.21 s, N=16 2.0 vs 0.83 s,
  N=24 24 vs 4.8 s) and crosses over to *slower than even the iterative baseline* by N=32. A scalable
  sparse LU in JAX needs host callbacks (off-GPU), so the matrix-free swept apply is the right sparse
  realization, not a factorization.

## Binding decisions
- **Physics and numerics are separate.** Scheme
  classes live here; operators in `discretization/` consume them via constructor
  injection. An operator never inlines a scheme choice.
- **Scheme classes are the DRY mechanism** (CLAUDE Principle 2): one scheme class defined
  once, injected into many operators/equations. Never copy a reconstruction into two
  operators.
- **Published bottleneck to respect:** Gauss gradients are not formally 2nd-order and
  cap accuracy on skewed grids — for *both* the primary and differentiated fields
  (DeGroot 2019). This is *why* the block is
  swappable. Keep the interface clean enough that upgrading it is a drop-in.

## Testability seam
Each scheme is tested by reconstructing an analytic field on a refined-mesh sequence and
asserting the measured order of accuracy — with **no physics involved** (the gradient's
exact oracle is `∇f` of a known `f`). Use `tests/support/meshes.py::perturbed_grid_2d` for
the refinement sequence; **measure error on interior cells only** (boundary cells reconstruct
at lower order and pollute the rate), and use **random** perturbation (not smooth) to
expose the true skewed-grid order (smooth perturbations cancel errors and flatter the
scheme). This harness is also the experiment that decides whether the implicit gradient
earns its Schur coupling.
