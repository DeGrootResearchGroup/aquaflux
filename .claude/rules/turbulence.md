The k–ω shear-stress-transport (SST) closure and the loop that couples it to the coupled p–U
flow. The forward coupling is **segregated** (an outer Picard loop, decided with the author) —
but segregation is a *forward-solve strategy only*; the differentiable promise still requires
the adjoint of the **unfrozen coupled residual**. Governed by the root `CLAUDE.md` Engineering
Principles; the flow block it feeds is `.claude/rules/flow.md`, and the Newton / linear-solve
adjoint machinery it must reuse is `.claude/rules/solve.md`.

## Status — BUILT (segregated forward solve **and** monolithic coupled solve + coupled adjoint)
- **`sst.py` — `SSTModel`.** Menter's SST constants and the quantities derived directly from
  them (the F₁/F₂ blend, the eddy-viscosity limiter).
- **`strain.py`** — the strain-rate magnitude `S = sqrt(2 S_ij S_ij)` the production terms read.
  - **The `sqrt` is guarded at `S = 0` (binding, `_safe_sqrt`).** `S` is a Euclidean norm, so it has a
    cone point at zero (like `|x| = sqrt(x²)`): the value is continuous but the `sqrt` chain rule is
    `dS = dq/(2S) = 0/0 = NaN` there. A **uniform** velocity region has `S = 0` *identically* (zero
    gradient), and a body-force periodic channel's hybrid IC is the exactly-uniform plug
    (`scales.body_force_velocity`, `u_y ≡ 0`), so **every interior cell** was `S = 0` and the coupled
    Jacobian came back NaN in all of them — the monolithic Newton then stalled immediately (every step
    NaN → `DivergenceGuard` rejects → escalates to the cap → `max_steps` → raises). The double-`where`
    `_safe_sqrt` clamps the `sqrt` argument to 1 on the branch discarded at zero, so `dS = 0` (the
    minimum-norm subgradient) at exactly `S = 0` while the value and derivative are **bit-identical to a
    plain `sqrt` wherever `S > 0`** (verified: forward value, jvp, and jacrev all bit-equal). Returning
    `0` is the *correct* local derivative, not just NaN-avoidance: every consumer of `S` is locally flat
    in the flow there — production reads `S²` (`d/dt S² = 2S·dS → 0`) and the eddy-viscosity limiter's
    `max(a1 ω, S F2)` picks the strain-independent `a1 ω` branch — and `S = 0` never occurs at a
    converged (sheared) field, so the exact adjoint at the fixed point is untouched. This is what lets
    the coupled solve self-start from the symmetric plug with **no symmetry-breaking perturbation** (see
    the `initialization.py` note). Pinned by `test_strain.py` (finite/zero Jacobian at `S = 0`; FD-match
    where `S > 0`).
- **`sources.py`** — the k and ω production / destruction / cross-diffusion terms as
  `VolumeSourceFn` volume-source operators (the transport equations reuse the shared advection
  and diffusion flux operators; only the sources are turbulence-specific).
  - **Both productions are limited at the destruction scale (binding).** `KProduction` caps
    `P_k = min(ν_t S², 10 β* k ω)`; `OmegaProduction` caps the *same way* — `α min(S², 10 β* k ω/ν_t)`,
    i.e. `α/ν_t` times the limited k-production (equivalently OpenFOAM's `(c1/a1)β*ω·max(a1ω, F2 S)`,
    c1=10). It reads the frozen closure (`nu_t`, `k`, `omega`, `strain_rate`), so it has **no derivative
    in the solved ω** (adds no ω-Jacobian diagonal) and differentiates exactly through the *live*
    closure in the coupled residual. A tiny `_EDDY_VISCOSITY_FLOOR` guards the `1/ν_t` at the `k→0`
    edge only (k/ν_t is finite where the cap bites). The unlimited `α S²` over-stiffened the ω equation
    in high-strain / transient regions — one of the robustness gaps behind the near-wall `k` collapse
    (#126). `KProduction.explicit_limiter` still freezes *its* cap's solved `k` for the M-matrix
    forward path; ω needs no such flag (its cap is already field-independent).
- **`transport.py` — `SSTTurbulence`, `SSTClosureFields`.** Assembles the k and ω scalar
  transport residuals on the flow's Rhie–Chow mass flux, with μ_t a **frozen per-cell field**
  recomputed once per outer sweep.
- **`preconditioner.py`** — the convection-diffusion AMG preconditioner for the stiff k/ω scalar
  Krylov solves at high Reynolds number (the scalar analogue of the velocity-block work). It assembles
  its frozen operator with the shared `aquaflux.solve.frozen_operator.convection_diffusion_operator` and
  hands the **assembled matrix** to `build_convection_hierarchy` / `build_air_hierarchy` (the coarsening
  library is operator-in, #45); its reaction+boundary diagonal still comes from its own `J·1`
  derivation, which is a genuinely different source, not a copy of the interior stencil.
  `scalar_transport_preconditioner` returns a **`ScalarTransportPreconditioner`** strategy
  (`ConvectionAmgPreconditioner` / `AirAmgPreconditioner`) rather than the old opaque `lambda phi: solve`.
  These are plain frozen dataclasses, **not `equinox.Module`s** — see the binding note in
  `.claude/rules/solve.md`; making them pytrees breaks both the IFT adjoint and the jit cache.
  `ScaledScalarPreconditioner(inner, scale)` wraps one with a fixed per-cell output factor — the
  reciprocal chain-rule scaling a log-transformed scalar block needs (above); also a frozen dataclass.
  - **`reuse=` refreshes a stale k/ω preconditioner without changing the compilation signature.**
    `scalar_transport_preconditioner(..., reuse=old)` (threaded through
    `SSTTurbulence.k_preconditioner` / `omega_preconditioner`) re-derives the *values* at a new state on
    the reused hierarchy's **frozen coarsening**. This is what makes a mid-march refresh affordable, and
    the measured reason to want one: on a separated pitzDaily state, refreshing the **scalar** AMGs is
    worth ~2.4× in outer GMRES cycles (30 → 13 at β=2 with the production lAIR scalars; refreshing the
    *flow* block is worth nothing, 30 → 29). It matters **only for `method="air"`** — lAIR's C/F split
    reads operator values, so a plain rebuild changes every shape below the first level or two and would
    force a recompile of the solve it accelerates (`reuse` routes to
    `~aquaflux.solve.refresh_air_hierarchy`). For `method="twolevel"` the aggregation reads only the
    graph, so a rebuild is already structure-preserving and `reuse` is accepted but changes nothing.
    A `ScaledScalarPreconditioner` wrapper is unwrapped (the log chain-rule scale is re-derived at the
    new state by the caller), and reusing across *different* methods raises. Pinned in
    `tests/unit/test_scalar_transport_preconditioner.py`: the lAIR refresh preserves shapes **where a
    rebuild provably does not**, the twolevel path is structure-preserving either way, and a refreshed
    preconditioner **beats the stale one on the developed operator** (so the reused split is a real
    trade, not a no-op).
- **The scalar policy's two halves have different lifetimes (binding, #105).** `ScalarShiftPolicy` carries
  a **shift diagonal rebuilt every sweep** (so the pseudo-time damping keeps tracking the operator as
  ν_t grows — freezing it would under-damp the march and lean on `DivergenceGuard` escalation) and an
  **AMG preconditioner built once and carried** (it only accelerates the Krylov iteration, and rebuilding
  it per sweep cost ~0.9 s (k) + ~1.0 s (ω) at 4k cells *and* re-compiled the whole solve every sweep).
  `SSTTurbulence` therefore splits `k_preconditioner`/`omega_preconditioner` (frozen, `method=`) from
  `k_shift_policy`/`omega_shift_policy` (per sweep, `preconditioner=`); `solve_segregated` builds the
  former on the first sweep and the latter every sweep. Measured: traces per sweep went `[5,5,5,5,5]` →
  `[5,5,0,0,0]` with the converged field bit-identical. Pinned by
  `test_a_carried_preconditioner_compiles_the_scalar_solve_once`.
- **`transport.py`'s `omega_residual` returns a `WallFixedResidual`, not a closure (binding, #105).** It is
  rebuilt every sweep and passed into the jitted scalar solve, so as a bare closure it landed on
  `filter_jit`'s static side and identity-missed the cache every sweep. As an `equinox.Module` its arrays
  ride on the traced side and only their *values* change. (`k_residual` already returned a bound
  `ResidualAssembler.residual`, which equinox treats as a pytree — that one was always fine.) Note the
  contrast with the preconditioner above: a *per-sweep* callable must be a pytree, a *frozen* one must not.
- **`boundary.py`** — inlet/wall closures for k and ω over the generic scalar boundary machinery.
  - **The wall ω is `6ν/(β₁d²)`, NOT `60ν/(β₁d²)` (binding — the constant depends on where it is
    imposed).** `omega_wall_value` is fixed at the wall-adjacent **cell centroid** (`FixedValueCells`
    at `wall_distance[wall_cells]`), so it must be the analytical sublayer solution *at that distance*:
    `ν d²ω/dy² = β₁ω²` with `ω = A/y²` gives `A = 6ν/β₁`. The `60` form is a wall-**face** value — 10×
    the asymptote, standing in for the singularity at `y = 0` (Menter, 1994) — and was being imposed at
    the cell centroid, putting near-wall ω 10× high (suppressed near-wall `ν_t`, stiffer ω equation, and
    a realized κ below the reference). Do **not** "restore" the 60 without also moving the imposition to
    the wall face. The unit test pins the **ODE residual**, not the coefficient, so the two forms cannot
    be swapped silently again.
- **`driver.py` — `solve_segregated`.** The outer Picard loop: μ_t → flow solve → k solve → ω
  solve, with under-relaxation and positivity floors as the stabilizers, and injected
  `solve_flow` / `solve_scalar` so the driver is pure orchestration. The per-sweep coupling is
  `momentum.with_eddy_viscosity(ν_t)` — the driver hands over the closure's **kinematic** `ν_t` and
  the flow assembler forms `μ_eff = μ + ρν_t` from its own material properties, so the driver never
  restates the closure relation and takes **no `density=` argument** (see `.claude/rules/flow.md`).
  An injected momentum stand-in must therefore provide `with_eddy_viscosity`. The loop **stops on the coupled
  Picard increment** (`_relative_change` — the largest per-field relative L2 change over a sweep <
  `rtol`), with `max_sweeps` only a backstop; the outer under-relaxation is the **SER ramp**
  `_sweep_relaxation` (opens from the `relaxation` floor toward `relaxation_max` as that increment
  falls, constant when `relaxation_max is None`). Hitting `max_sweeps` without converging warns.
  - **Flow-solve seam is `solve_flow(momentum, state) → (momentum, state)` (binding).** The flow solve
    returns the assembler as well as the state, because a **bulk-velocity-constrained** solve
    (`flow.bulk_velocity_flow_solve`) carries its converged body force out on the assembler — so a
    mass-flow-driven periodic channel needs **no separate controller**, the constraint is enforced
    inside the flow Newton. The old inline **proportional mass-flow controller was DELETED** (its
    `bulk_velocity_target`/`bulk_velocity_gain`/`flow_direction` args gone): it updated β *after* a
    fixed-β flow solve, so at high Reynolds / high aspect ratio it measured a bulk velocity that had
    already spiked ~17× (β tripled while μ_t was stale) and collapsed the near-wall `k` onto its floor.
    The bordered solve makes `⟨U⟩ = U_bar` hold by construction; see `.claude/rules/flow.md`. An
    unconstrained `solve_flow` returns the assembler unchanged.
  - **The sweep body between the injected solves is jitted and assembles the flow fields once
    (binding, #106).** The pre-solve μ_t and the post-solve `(mdot, closure)` run in two module-level
    `eqx.filter_jit` prologues (`_sweep_eddy_viscosity`, `_sweep_closure`) instead of op-by-op eagerly
    (the eager path dispatched `velocity_gradient` / `mass_flux` / `closure_fields` one op at a time —
    ~130 ms/sweep of avoidable overhead at 1600 cells). `_sweep_closure` calls
    `momentum.flow_fields(flow)` **once** for both the velocity gradient the closure reads and the
    Rhie–Chow `mdot` the scalars advect on (the pre-solve μ_t uses the lightweight `velocity_gradient`,
    which is all it needs before `mdot` exists). `solve_segregated` binds the k/ω boundaries once via
    `turbulence.resolve_boundaries()` before the loop, so those compiled prologues never re-run the
    dynamic-shape patch resolve inside `closure_fields`'s gradient assembler. Bit-identical to the old
    eager path; pinned by `test_segregated_prologues_match_the_eager_assembly`.
- **`coupled.py` — `CoupledRANS`, `solve_coupled` (Option 2, the target engine).** The monolithic
  residual `R(u, p, k, ω)` over the flat `[flow…, k, ω]` state (`CoupledRANSLayout`, whose `unpack`
  yields the momentum block's own `[u,p]` sub-vector so `MomentumContinuity` runs on it unchanged),
  with **nothing frozen**: μ_t, the strain `S(u)`, the Rhie–Chow flux, and the closure are live, so
  one Newton solve sees the exact cross-block Jacobian. Globalized by `coupled_continuation`
  (a block `CoupledShiftPolicy` = velocity `a_P` shift ⊕ the k/ω transport-diagonal shifts, and a
  block-diagonal preconditioner gluing `BlockPreconditioner` to the two scalar CD-AMGs; the AMG
  hierarchies + numpy-built scalar shift diagonals **frozen at a reference state** off-jit à la
  `reused_flow_solve`, the velocity `a_P` live). Handed to `ImplicitNewtonSolver`, it gives the
  **exact coupled adjoint** (§5) — a single transpose solve on the unfrozen `R_coupled`. The ω wall
  rows are `FixedValueCells`. `CoupledRANS.build` pre-resolves the k/ω boundaries (via
  `turbulence.resolve_boundaries()`, the shared idempotent bind the segregated driver also uses) so the
  per-eval assembler rebuild's `resolve` is an idempotent no-op (else a dynamic-shape `nonzero` on
  traced mesh labels breaks the jit). **`CoupledRANS.residual` assembles the Rhie–Chow flow fields once
  (#106):** it builds the `closure` first and takes `nu_t` from it (rather than a separate
  `eddy_viscosity` recomputing the same strain), then one `momentum.flow_fields(flow)` feeds both
  `residual_from_fields` and the `mdot` the scalars advect on — was 3× `_flow_fields` per eval, ~1.85×
  the trace/compile and AD-tape size. **Per-scalar variable parametrization** (`k_transform` /
  `omega_transform`, both `ScalarVariableTransform`, default `DirectScalars` = identity): the coupled
  residual is always written in the *physical* `k`/`ω` (recovered by `physical_fields`), so a transform
  changes only the Newton iterate space, not the root — the residual at the mapped state equals the
  direct residual at the same physical fields (unit-pinned to 1e-13). `DirectScalars` carries positivity
  by the pseudo-transient shift + divergence guard (no in-residual floor); `LogScalars` (`φ = e^w`) makes
  the field `> 0` **by construction under any Newton step** — the fix for the stiff high-Re case where a
  full step drives `ω` negative and `ν_t = k/ω` flips sign without the residual going non-finite (so the
  guard never trips). **Use `omega_transform=LogScalars()`, `k` direct (binding):** `ω` is the field that
  goes negative and `log(ω)` is well-conditioned (`ω` bounded away from 0, large near walls); `log(k)` is
  **not** — `k → 0` at a no-slip wall (Dirichlet 0) so `log(k) → −∞` there stalls the near-wall cells (the
  full-log form descends then freezes; measured). FD-verified for both forms: coupled ‖R‖→machine-zero,
  agrees with the segregated fixed point, adjoint matches finite differences.
  - **The reparametrized block's preconditioner/shift are chain-rule-scaled at the reference (binding).**
    The physics Jacobian w.r.t. `w` picks up `d(φ)/d(w) = jacobian_scale(φ)` (`= φ` for log). `coupled_continuation`
    recovers the physical reference via `physical_fields`, scales each scalar shift diagonal by that factor,
    and wraps its (physical-operator) AMG in `ScaledScalarPreconditioner` by the reciprocal — so the frozen
    preconditioner acts on the reparametrized block without rebuilding the hierarchy. `_reparametrized_preconditioner`
    returns the preconditioner **unchanged** when the factor is one, so the `DirectScalars` path is bit-identical.
  - **`coupled_continuation` globalizes with a line search + a larger-restart Krylov (the pitzDaily
    performance fix).** Two measured facts drove this. **(1) The full coupled Newton step
    from the hybrid IC overshoots by ~10⁷×** (‖R‖ 220 → 5.8e9); the pseudo-transient step's only recourse
    used to be escalating β — a *full re-solve* — and escalating β (16/64) still did **not** descend
    (rel ≈ 1.0 → the full-mesh march *stalled*, which had been misread as "slow, compute-heavy"). A
    **backtracking line search** on the one β₀ solve finds α≈¼ → rel≈0.48 (residual halved), so
    `coupled_continuation` sets `line_search=_COUPLED_LINE_SEARCH` (see `.claude/rules/solve.md`); β
    escalation stays the fallback for a bad *direction*, not an overshoot. With it the full-mesh solve
    **descends** (rel 1.0 → 0.48 → 0.44 → 0.31 → 0.20 → ~0.18 over ~6 steps) instead of *stalling at
    rel 1.0* — the case is now solvable at all, a correctness fix, not just speed. **(2) The shifted
    solve needs a large Krylov subspace:** `_COUPLED_FORWARD_SOLVER` is restart-120 GMRES (the shared
    restart-40 default discards too much Arnoldi history on this stiff saddle system; ~1.4× faster to
    the same tight solution). Tolerances stay **tight** — an inexact solve is unsafe under log-`ω` (an
    inaccurate log step is exponentiated and diverges), so loosening the linear tolerance is **not** a
    lever here (measured: it breaks the march).
  - **The march's residual measure is the plain Euclidean ‖R‖ by default; the block-scaled per-field
    measure is opt-in (`block_scaled_norm=True`).** A `BlockScaledNorm` over `[flow, k, ω]` (each block
    divided by its own initial magnitude, `_coupled_residual_norm`) was built so the globalization weighs
    every field rather than the `ω` block that dominates ‖R‖ (`ω` O(1e5), `k` O(1e-3)) — the concern being
    that a step collapsing `k` barely moves the `ω`-dominated ‖R‖ and is accepted. But **measured, it
    *stalls* the pitzDaily march**: the per-block relative norm plateaus long before the fields converge,
    so `coupled_continuation`/`mass_flow_coupled_continuation` default to `jnp.linalg.norm` and expose
    `block_scaled_norm` (default `False`) to request the block measure for experimentation. The helper and
    the `BlockScaledNorm` class are kept as that opt-in path, not deleted.
  - **`beta_floor` (SER lower bound) is available but off by default (a measured wash).** Bounding
    `β = max(beta_floor, β₀(‖R‖/‖R₀‖)^p)` keeps each late shifted solve out of the ill-conditioned low-`β`
    regime (correctness-safe — the floor scales the correction `δ`, which vanishes at the root, so it never
    moves the converged state). But end-to-end it is a **net wash** (cheaper late solves cancel the extra
    Newton steps), so it defaults to `0`; wired through `coupled_continuation` for further evaluation. The
    settled coupled-solve cost is the diagonal-block-preconditioner weakness at high Reynolds number, **not**
    the residual measure, `β` floor, or missing cross-coupling (a block-triangular preconditioner was worse
    — non-convergent on recirculating pitzDaily). See `.claude/rules/solve.md`.
  - **The coupled flow block uses the convection-aware AMG + MSIMPLER Schur, not the smoothed/SIMPLE
    default (`_coupled_shift_policy`).** A RANS case is high-Reynolds, and the default
    `BlockPreconditioner.build` config (viscous-**smoothed** velocity AMG, which is Peclet-blind, + the
    **SIMPLE** `a_P` Schur, which degrades with convection) produces a poor momentum-block direction once
    the flow separates. Measured on the developed pitzDaily field (shifted Newton direction vs the true
    one): smoothed+SIMPLE gives **cos 0.40** and the march stalls at rel ~0.18; **`velocity="convection"`
    + `schur_scaling="msimpler"` gives cos 0.998** *and* cuts the shifted solve from ~120–580 GMRES
    cycles to ~17 (each march step ~8× cheaper). Both stay valid **frozen at the cold initial state**
    (MSIMPLER's Schur is velocity-independent; the convection linearization is Peclet-robust), so **the
    FLOW block needs no reference refresh** — verified two ways: IC-frozen cos 0.996 vs plateau-rebuilt
    0.998, and refreshing the flow block alone at a separated pitzDaily state is if anything slightly
    *worse* (31 → 34 outer cycles). It is **not** the flow↔turbulence cross-coupling (the block-*diagonal*
    preconditioner with the right config already reaches cos 0.998 — a block-triangular coupling was
    built, measured, and is worse; see `.claude/rules/solve.md`). **The k/ω *scalar* AMGs are the
    exception: they do go stale, and refreshing them alone once the flow separates is worth ~2.6× in
    outer cycles** (31 → 12) — the one staleness lever that pays; see the staleness bullet in
    `.claude/rules/solve.md`. Overridable via `preconditioner_kwargs`.
  - **Remaining limiter — the k equation drift (the open item).** With the config above the march pushes
    past the omega plateau (rel 0.18 → ~0.09), but past there the **direct-`k` residual grows** (rel 1 →
    ~5× over a few steps) as the high-Reynolds production develops, while `ω` and the flow converge; `k`'s
    *absolute* residual stays small (so ‖R‖ still descends) but the growth re-stalls the march near rel
    ~0.09. This is a `k`-stability issue, not a preconditioner one. **log-`k` is not the fix** (ill-
    conditioned at the `k→0` no-slip walls — the reason `k` is direct). The k-tied realizability floor
    (#126) and the production limiter are the closure levers; treat high-Reynolds `k` stability under the
    coupled log-`ω` solve as the open follow-up.
  - **The per-scalar transform is layout-consistent through both coupled solves (binding).** `solve_coupled`
    and `solve_coupled_mass_flow` both map the physical IC into the solved space with `state_from_physical`
    and return `physical_fields` — so `LogScalars` is correct through the mass-flow-constrained path too
    (identity for `DirectScalars`, which is all the mass-flow tests exercise). Do not reintroduce a bare
    `pack_state`/`layout.unpack` at a solve boundary: it packs physical values as if they were the solved
    unknown, silently wrong under any non-identity transform.
  - **`solve_coupled_mass_flow` — the coupled solve with the bulk velocity held by a Lagrange
    multiplier (#128).** A streamwise-periodic channel is driven to a target bulk velocity `U_bar`, so
    the body force `β` along the flow direction is itself a **coupled unknown** appended to the state
    and the coupled residual bordered with the constraint row `⟨U_dir⟩ − U_bar = 0`: one honest
    augmented residual `R_aug([flow…, k, ω, β]) = [R_coupled(state; β); ⟨U_dir⟩ − U_bar]`, driven by a
    single `ImplicitNewtonSolver`. The border column/row `(a, c)` and the Schur (constraint)
    preconditioner are the flow block's own primitives (`_constraint_vectors`,
    `_bordered_preconditioner`, `_with_body_force` from `flow/mean_velocity.py`) reused in the coupled
    `[flow…, k, ω]` layout by `_coupled_constraint_vectors` — the same Schur elimination one careful
    place keeps consistent, not re-derived. Globalized by `mass_flow_coupled_continuation`, which
    borders the **same** `_coupled_shift_policy` (extracted from `coupled_continuation` for exactly this
    reuse) with a `_MassFlowBorderedPolicy`: the shift diagonal gains a **zero** for `β` (the linear
    constraint row needs no pseudo-time damping) and the block preconditioner is wrapped by the
    constraint preconditioner. Because the constraint lives *inside* the coupled residual, the coupled
    IFT adjoint **carries it** — `jax.grad` through the converged constrained solve is the sensitivity
    of the turbulent field *at fixed bulk velocity* (FD-verified). This is the monolithic counterpart of
    the segregated bordered flow solve (`flow.bulk_velocity_flow_solve`): the segregated loop does **not**
    converge on this body-force channel, so the constrained fixed point is cross-validated by two
    independent AMG coarsenings (`air` ≡ `twolevel`, same `β`) — the periodic analogue of the inlet
    coupled-vs-segregated cross-check. Pinned by `test_coupled_mass_flow.py` (constraint met + turbulent
    + floors inactive; method-independence; the adjoint FD gate).
- **`initialization.py` — `hybrid_initialize` (cold-start, the reason `solve_coupled` self-starts).**
  The monolithic Newton is a *local* method: from a raw cold start (`u=0`, uniform k/ω) it **stalls** —
  the near-wall ω fixation alone injects a `~6ν/(β₁d²)` jump, and a uniform interior is far from a
  consistent field the inner solve can precondition. `hybrid_initialize(momentum, turbulence)` builds a
  cheap physical IC (a few linear Laplace solves): **potential-flow velocity** (`flow/initialization.py`
  `potential_flow`), **Laplace-smoothed k** (harmonic interpolant of its BCs), and **ω** =
  boundary-propagated interior **raised to the analytical viscous-sublayer profile `ω(y)=6ν/(β₁y²)` at
  every cell's own wall distance** (via `jnp.maximum`). A *Laplace*-ω over-diffuses the large wall value
  into the interior; seeding only the wall cells (the earlier form) leaves a **cliff** between the fixed
  wall cell and its neighbour on the flat interpolant, and that neighbour's ω equation then carries
  almost the entire initial ω residual. The profile is the exact solution of the near-wall balance
  `ν d²ω/dy² = β₁ω²`, so every near-wall cell starts on the same decay curve; it falls off as `1/y²`, so
  a few cells out it drops below the interpolant and the `maximum` leaves the core untouched, and at the
  wall cells it equals the fixation value (same distance/expression) so those rows stay consistent.
  Measured: this roughly **halves** the initial ‖R_ω‖ (otherwise ~99% concentrated in the wall-adjacent
  cells — the discrete **diffusion-vs-quadratic-destruction** balance, independent of convection /
  production / cross-diffusion). The profile is also the **smooth ramp the held-in-reserve log-ω form
  wants** (`w=log ω`, below): `w(y)=log(6ν/β₁)−2 log y`, whose largest cross-face `Δw` is set by the
  mesh growth ratio (~2, Reynolds-independent), where the cliff would be a `~log(ω_wall/ω_core)` jump in
  `w` that **grows with Reynolds number** as the wall spacing shrinks (measured max `Δw` 5.4→8.3 from Re
  2.5k→25k, vs ~2.4 for the profile). From this IC the coupled Newton converges from nothing
  (~10–15 steps, FD-verified). `solve_coupled(coupled)` with no initial
  state calls it automatically; the segregated pre-smooth is no longer required to reach the basin (still
  available as a fallback). **An exactly symmetric velocity is fine** — the coupled solve self-starts
  from the exactly-uniform body-force plug (`u_y ≡ 0`) with no perturbation. (Earlier this stalled, and
  was misread as a "measure-zero degeneracy in the inner solve"; it was actually the `sqrt`-at-zero NaN
  in `strain_rate_magnitude` — a uniform plug has `S = 0` in every interior cell — now fixed at the
  source by the guarded `sqrt`, see the `strain.py` note. Do **not** reintroduce an IC perturbation to
  "lift" it: the degeneracy was never in the IC.) The IC is a forward device (the converged-state
  adjoint is IC-independent); when differentiating, pass an explicit state built outside `jax.grad`.
  - **Body-force-driven domains need equilibrium levels, not interpolants (binding).** A
    streamwise-periodic channel has **no inlet**, so both smoothed fields are degenerate: `k` is the
    harmonic interpolant between all-zero wall Dirichlets (**identically zero**), and `ω` is a
    pure-Neumann solve whose interior carries nothing. Left alone that starts the solve at `k=0` →
    `ν_t=0` — not a poor guess but the **laminar** problem, which for a turbulent case is the wrong
    equations. Both levels therefore come from the **friction velocity the force balance fixes**,
    `u_τ = √(βh/ρ)` (`flow/scales.py::friction_velocity`, `h = V/A_wall`): `k = u_τ²/√β*`
    (`boundary.py::equilibrium_k`) and `ω = inlet_omega(k, 0.09h)`, applied with `jnp.maximum` so it
    only ever raises the fields (the `u_τ>0` branch). **Fix k and ω together or not at
    all** — raising `k` while `ω` sits at its `1e-8` floor gives `ν_t = k/ω ~ 10⁶`, far worse than the
    laminar start. The length scale is the **outer mixing length `0.09h`**, not the `0.07·D_h`
    inlet-specification convention: the latter is for an inlet, and here overshot the developed-channel
    `ν_t` by ~3.5× (measured `ν_t/ν` 373 vs the correct 120 = `0.09u_τh/ν`, which the shipped default
    now hits exactly). Pinned by `test_hybrid_initialize_gives_a_developed_channel_eddy_viscosity`.
  - **Inlet-driven wall-bounded domains collapse k too — floor it at the inlet level (binding).** The
    body-force degeneracy has a subtler inlet-driven twin: even *with* an inlet, the walls carry
    `k=Dirichlet(0)` over the whole domain and **dominate the small inlet patch by area**, so the
    harmonic `k` interpolant decays toward zero a few channel heights downstream (measured median `k`
    `~1e-6` at L/H≈8, collapsing further with length — the **laminar** field again). `friction_velocity`
    is zero here, so the equilibrium branch does not fire; the `else` branch instead floors `k` at
    **`jnp.max(k)`** — the interpolant's peak, which by the maximum principle is the inlet Dirichlet
    value — giving a uniform inlet-level interior. **ω needs no matching floor**: its walls are
    *zero-gradient*, not Dirichlet-0, so its interpolant stays at `~ω_in` (verified: exactly `ω_in` for
    a constant-`ω_in` inlet) and `(k_in, ω_in)` is the consistent inlet eddy viscosity `ν_t=k_in/ω_in`.
    Low interior `k` is a prime suspect for the coupled Newton's large near-wall k-swing on a separating
    high-Re case, so this is a coupled-convergence fix, not only a cosmetic IC one. Pinned by
    `test_hybrid_initialize_floors_inlet_driven_k_at_the_turbulent_level`.

**Issue #69 — CLOSED path (do not re-derive without reading it):** all three planned steps shipped —
scalar continuation (#73), Option 1 hardening (convergence stop + adaptive relaxation), and Option 2
(the monolithic coupled residual + its IFT adjoint, the target engine). The segregated loop is
**retained as a forward pre-smoother / fallback**, not the sensitivity model; for gradients use the
coupled `solve_coupled` (its adjoint is exact) — never differentiate `solve_segregated` (forward-only,
unrolls the Picard sweeps, which §5 forbids). The formerly-held-in-reserve **log-variable form is now
built** (`LogScalars` on `omega_transform`, above), promoted exactly as anticipated: the stiff high-Re
separating pitzDaily case (`validation/pitzdaily_openfoam`) drives the direct `ω` negative, and
`omega_transform=LogScalars()` keeps `ω > 0` so the coupled solve no longer poisons its closure. The
form is validated (channel + tests); efficient convergence on the *full* pitzDaily mesh is the open
tuning follow-up noted above.

## Binding decisions

- **Segregated forward, coupled adjoint (design note §5 — binding) — BUILT via `solve_coupled`.**
  Segregation is a **forward-solve strategy only**. For exact sensitivities the adjoint is the
  implicit-function-theorem solve on the full **unfrozen** coupled residual
  `R_coupled(k, ω, U, p; params) = 0` at the converged state — the `solve/` two-level
  implicit-diff machinery — **not** a differentiation of the Picard iteration. This is now realized:
  `coupled.py`'s `CoupledRANS.residual` **is** that unfrozen `R_coupled`, and `solve_coupled` hands it
  to `ImplicitNewtonSolver`, whose adjoint is a single transpose solve (FD-verified). At the fixed
  point the frozen fields equal the live values, so the coupled residual is satisfied and its
  adjoint is exact; the segregated outer loop is a forward convergence device that is **absent from
  the sensitivity model**. Differentiate **`solve_coupled`, never `solve_segregated`** (the latter is
  forward-only and its docstring says so). When building the coupled continuation for a differentiated
  solve, construct it **outside `jax.grad`** (concrete preconditioner params) and pass it in — see the
  flow preconditioner's same constraint.

- **Never unroll the outer loop onto the differentiation path.** A fixed-count `for` over sweeps
  that is differentiated directly is exactly the failure `solve.md` names ("no loops on the
  differentiation path"). If the coupled solve is not yet wrapped in the coupled-residual IFT
  adjoint, it is **not done** — it is an intermediate step (Principle 0), and the deferred adjoint
  must be filed as a tracked issue at merge time, not left implicit.

- **Convergence-based outer stop, not a fixed sweep count — BUILT.** The loop tests the coupled
  Picard increment and stops on it (`rtol`), with `max_sweeps` only a backstop and a warning when the
  cap is hit unconverged. Do **not** reintroduce a hard-coded `sweeps` count. The increment measure
  is the residual-agnostic per-field relative change, not a raw combined norm (the field scales
  differ by orders of magnitude).

- **Globalize the outer loop and the scalar sub-solves like everything else.** The flow block is
  globalized by pseudo-transient continuation; the k/ω transport sub-solves and the outer coupling
  must reach the same standard (a scalar `ShiftPolicy` continuation on the transport diagonal for the
  sub-solves; adaptive under-relaxation — **the SER ramp is built** — with Aitken/Anderson or a
  monolithic coupled residual as the further steps, for the loop). Constant under-relaxation plus
  positivity floors is the *stabilizer of last resort*, not the globalization.

- **Positivity floors must be inactive at convergence (adjoint honesty, design note §3.3 —
  binding).** `k ← max(k, k_floor)`, `ω ← max(ω, ω_floor)` and the `CD_kω` / F-blend floors have zero
  gradient in the clamped region; they pollute the sensitivity **unless inactive at the fixed point**
  (`k, ω > floor` everywhere, which holds for any properly resolved RANS field). State this precondition
  in code and **check it**: if a case converges with a floor active, the sensitivity through that cell is
  wrong — surface it, do not ship it. (Log-variable transport `φ = e^w` — **built** as `LogScalars`, above —
  is the structural fix: it removes the floor entirely for the transformed field, which stays `> 0` by
  construction, so there is no clamped region to pollute the sensitivity. Use it on `ω`, not `k`.)
  - **The ω floor is the k-tied realizability floor `ω ≥ k/(nut_max_coeff·ν)` (default `nut_max_coeff
    = 1e5`), NOT a fixed value (#126).** It caps `ν_t = k/ω` at `nut_max_coeff·ν`; being tied to the
    current `k` it is **inactive at convergence** for a physical field (`ν_t/ν` is O(10²) ≪ 1e5), so it
    honours the precondition above rather than pinning near-wall cells the way the old fixed `1e-8` ω
    floor could. `omega_floor` remains only as a tiny absolute backstop (`max(realizability, ω_floor)`).
    Pinned by the law-of-the-wall test asserting `ω > k/(1e5 ν)` everywhere at the converged state.

- **Frozen coupling data rides as injected pytree leaves** (μ_t, the frozen ∇u, mdot), the same
  blessed mechanism the coupled solver already uses to inject `mdot` — no new freezing mechanism, and
  no re-coupling μ_t ↔ (k, ω) inside a residual via a `Calculated` property in the segregated path.

## Testability seam
- `solve_segregated` takes **injected** `solve_flow` / `solve_scalar` closures, so the loop is
  tested against trivial stub solvers (e.g. identity / one-step) with a known fixed point — no full
  coupled solve needed to test the orchestration.
- Every turbulence operator (sources, strain, transport) ships an operator-level unit test on an
  analytic field (Principle 1), independent of the coupled solve.
- **The coupled solve needs an adjoint-correctness gate**, not only a smoke test: a test that
  `jax.grad` through the converged coupled turbulent solve is **iteration-count-independent** (the
  coupling analogue of Gate C; see the root `CLAUDE.md` Testing Architecture). An existence check
  ("stays stable, fields positive, μ_t active") does not establish the adjoint.
- **Never assert the positivity floors back (binding — they are tautologies).** `solve_segregated`
  clamps every sweep with `jnp.maximum(k, k_floor)` / `jnp.maximum(ω, ω_floor)`, so `min(k) >= 0`
  and `min(ω) > 0` hold for a *diverged* field exactly as well as a converged one. Likewise
  `max(μ_t)/ν > 1` is reached within a single sweep. A test built from these asserts only that the
  process did not crash. `test_high_reynolds_turbulent_channel_solves` was exactly this shape and
  was deleted rather than tuned: it cost ~45 minutes and its four assertions were all near-free,
  while its docstring claimed an isolation (unpreconditioned scalar solves) that the code
  contradicted. **A segregated-loop test must assert convergence** — that the Picard increment
  actually reached `rtol` (the driver only `warnings.warn`s otherwise, and returns the
  under-converged fields), or that the result matches an independently converged reference. The
  model is `test_coupled_rans.py`, which drives the loop to `rtol=1e-9` and asserts it reaches the
  coupled solve's fixed point to 1e-4.
