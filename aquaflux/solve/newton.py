"""The Newton correction on the cell residual.

One Newton step takes ``phi`` to ``phi + delta``, where the correction solves the linearized system
``J delta = -R(phi)`` and ``J = dR/dphi`` is applied **matrix-free** via a forward-mode directional
derivative (``jax.jvp``) — the Jacobian is never assembled, and no hand-derived linearization
coefficients exist. The linear solve is the differentiable
:func:`~aquaflux.solve.linear.solve_linear`.

The residual is supplied as a closure ``residual_fn(phi)``, so these functions are testable on any
analytic residual and never import a specific operator.

**This module is one step, not a driver.** For a *linear* residual — transient diffusion, Stokes
flow, a Laplace initializer — a single :func:`newton_step` is exact, and being plain traced
operations it differentiates in **both** modes: the forward-mode ``jacfwd`` that a scalar-parameter
sensitivity over a whole field wants, as well as reverse-mode. For a *nonlinear* residual, iterate
with :class:`~aquaflux.solve.ImplicitNewtonSolver`, which stops on a convergence test, globalizes
the march, and carries the implicit-function-theorem adjoint. Do **not** write a fixed-count loop
over :func:`newton_step` for a nonlinear residual: it cannot tell convergence from exhaustion, and
taping the unrolled steps is exactly the gradient path the two-level implicit differentiation exists
to avoid.

Neither function jits internally — the caller owns the jit boundary, so a step composes into
whatever the caller compiles. Wrap the call in ``equinox.filter_jit``; un-jitted, every operation
dispatches eagerly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residual_fn : callable
        Maps ``phi`` of shape ``(n_cells,)`` to the residual, same shape.
    phi : jnp.ndarray
        Current iterate, shape ``(n_cells,)``.
    solver : lineax.AbstractLinearSolver, optional
        Linear solver for the Newton step; defaults to the package default.
    preconditioner : callable, optional
        A factory ``phi -> M`` giving the left preconditioner ``M`` (a matvec approximating
        ``J^{-1}``) for the step's linear solve; built at the current iterate. ``M``'s
        coefficients must be ``stop_gradient``-ed so preconditioning stays gradient-transparent.

    """The raw Newton correction ``delta`` (solving ``J delta = -R(phi)``), ``R(phi)``, and the cost.

    Separated from :func:`newton_step` so a globalized driver can damp the step (a line search on
    ``phi + alpha delta``) using the same matrix-free, differentiable solve.

    Returns
    -------
    delta : jnp.ndarray
        The correction solving ``J delta = -R(phi)``, shape ``(n_cells,)``.
    r : jnp.ndarray
        The residual ``R(phi)``, returned so a caller doing a line search need not recompute it.
    cycles : jnp.ndarray
        The linear solve's restart-cycle count (an ``int32`` scalar), the cost of this step's solve.
        A forward-step strategy passes it on so a staged march can watch a frozen preconditioner go
        stale; a caller with no use for it drops it.
